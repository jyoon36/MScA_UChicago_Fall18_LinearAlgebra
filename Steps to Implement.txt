STEP1 : BEST MODEL TO PREDICT 15 KEYPOINTS
1. Modify number of hidden layers and nodes at each layer and create new models
2. Predict using the model
3. Calculate RMSE
4. Determine the best model to use

STEP2: CREATE ANOTHER VECTOR OF MEANINGFUL DISTANCES
1. Difference between the keypoints (x,y) eg. Dstance between 2 eyes, dist b/w right eye and nose, dist b/w left eye and nose, etc..

STEP3: CREATE TRAINING DATA FOR CLASSIFICATION
1. Take 100 (sample) pics of a person
2. Get 100 Meaningful distances vector
3. Average the values and store a single vector and label for the person
4. Repeat for 10 people

STEP4: CREATE A CLASSIFIER USING COSINE SIMILARITY
1. Input a new image
2. It should create a Meaningful distances vector as in STEP2
3. Perform cosine similarity with the above 10 vectors from STEP3
4. Use the label of the maximum value of match and display that as the name
